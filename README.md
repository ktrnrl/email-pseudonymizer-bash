# email-pseudonymizer-bashProject 

Description

This project processes unstructured .txt files and finds all email addresses using grep and sed/awk. It then pseudonymizes them according to the following rules:
	•	Removes dots (.) from the local part (before @).
	•	Removes everything after + (the descriptor).
	•	Lowercases the email address.
	•	Replaces the middle characters of the cleaned name with ***.

Example:

ababagalamaga@gmail.com → ab***ga@gmail.com  
b.abe+promo@gmail.com → ba***be@gmail.com
